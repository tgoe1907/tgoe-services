## About this project
This project is under construction.
To release it should implement a train hour capturing system for the trainers of the sports club "Turngemeinde Germania Ã–tigheim e.V."
It should provide functionality to capture the own train hours for automated cost accounting at the end of the year as well as functions to capture the groups members which are present in the train hours.
Therefore the project is structured in an backend part, that provides an API for capturing all relevant informations and a frontend part that gives access to it for user friendly experience.
